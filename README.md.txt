# SQL Data Cleaning & EDA Project – Global Layoffs Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete **data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** workflow using **MySQL** on a real-world global layoffs dataset.

The goal is to simulate how a **Data Engineer** cleans raw, messy data and prepares it for analysis.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- MySQL 8+
- SQL (CTEs, Window Functions)
- Git & GitHub

## 📂 Dataset
Global layoffs dataset containing information about:
- Company
- Industry
- Location
- Date
- Total layoffs
- Percentage laid off
- Funding details

## 🔄 Data Cleaning Steps
1. Created staging tables to preserve raw data
2. Removed duplicate records using `ROW_NUMBER()`
3. Standardized text fields (company, industry, country)
4. Converted string dates into proper `DATE` format
5. Handled NULL and blank values
6. Removed irrelevant records
7. Prepared a clean final table for analysis
